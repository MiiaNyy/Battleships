# Battleships

### General things

This is my take on the classic battleship gameboard game.

Players mission is to place ships on they game board and find enemy's ships and sink them before the enemy sinks players
ships.

There is three different game levels; Mediterranean, Atlantic and Pacific. the higher the mass of water, the larger the
game board and the greater the number of ships is that player, and the enemy has.

This was a project part of The Odin Project curriculum.

### Goals of this project

Main goal of this project was to exercise using Test Driven Development (TDD). Another important goal was to implement
every game related functions and actions using Player, Gameboard and Ship classes. The game loop will step through the
game turn by turn using only methods from other objects. This was a challenge to me because classes and objects were not
familiar to me before this project.

### What I learned

- How to use Jest in basic level
- What is TDD and how to implement using it.
    - At first, I started testing too large sections of my code but quickly noticed that it is much easier to focus 
      on smaller methods and functions
    - I need to improve this method a lot. Writing tests first and functions second was not as easy as I thought, and I 
      mainly wrote my functions first and after that the tests.
- I Improved my knowledge of classes and objects a lot in this project. Especially methods, getters and setters. 
  They are not as scary as they used to be, and I found out why they are so useful.
